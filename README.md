# minitimer

minitimer is a CLI (Command Line Interface) application. It works fine in both Linux shell and Windows PowerShell.
<br>

### Installation
* Clone the repo: ```$ git clone https://github.com/miguelsalva/minitimer.git```
* Install Python3
* Install pip(3)
* Install dependencies: ```$ pip install -r requirements.txt```
<br>

### Usage
```$ minitimer [time]```<br>
If you don't specify any time, the default is set to 25min (1500s), which is the standard on the Pomodoro Technique. Otherwise you should specify the time in seconds as the first argument.
