minitimer is a timing tool based on the [Pomodoro Technique](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pomodoro_Technique).<br>
minitimer is a CLI (Command Line Interface) application. It works fine in both Linux shell and Windows PowerShell.<br>
<br><br>

### Installation
1. Install Python3 and pip[3]
2. Clone the repo: ```$ git clone https://github.com/miguelsalva/minitimer.git```
3. Install dependencies: ```$ pip[3] install -r requirements.txt```
<br><br>

### Usage
If you don't specify any time, the default is set to 25min (1500s), which is the standard for the Pomodoro Technique:<br>
```
$ minitimer.py [time]
```

Otherwise you should specify the time in minutes (Xm) or seconds (Ys) as the first argument:
```
$ minitimer.py 10m
$ minitimer.py 50s
```
<br>
